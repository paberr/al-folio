# Project Ideas 2022

Generally, most of my projects have something to do with privacy.
The projects can range from building tools to formal modelling â€“ a wide range of options are available.

## Metaverse
- Privacy in the metaverse (or generally: VR applications)
    - Practical investigations what data can/is collected
    - Privacy measurements

## Blockchains
- Privacy of blockchain interoperability solutions
- Privacy of blockchain wallets

## Machine Learning
- Privacy of ML models
    - Privacy of user data when querying models
    - Privacy of models themselves
    - Privacy of training data

All of these projects are difficult and require previous knowledge in the area.
If you are interested in one of these ideas, please contact me first.
