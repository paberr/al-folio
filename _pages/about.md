I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science – Computer Security at the [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk).

My research interests are in the field of IT Security & Privacy with a focus on Health Data, Blockchain Technology, and Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

Previously, I was a freelance researcher & consultant, specialising in blockchain technology (e.g., [Nimiq](https://nimiq.com)).
Prior to that, I completed my PhD in the Information Security and Cryptography Group at [Saarland University](https://uni-saarland.de) under supervision of [Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/director/). My PhD thesis has the title *Quantifying and Mitigating Privacy Risks in Biomedical Data*.
